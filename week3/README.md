# Week 3 Python

## Prework

Lets do some codeacademy.

1. Do as much of the [codacademy python lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) as possible. Feel free to skip lessons if they are boring.
2. Write notes/questions to discuss next week/we can talk about it over the week.
3. Write a python function in `functions.py` that accepts a string `name` and prints and returns `hello <name>`
4. Write a function that takes an array/list and sums the all numbers
5. Write a function that takes an array list and creates a string where each item of the list is seperated by a space (like making a sentence)

## Notes about Python

OSX and linux machines come with python2.7 installed. We will start with 2.7, but next week we'll move to python3.

you can always enter your local python2.7 by typing:
```bash
python
```
to exit:
```python
exit()
```
To run the python `functions.py` script, simply `cd week3` then
```bash
./functions.py
```
