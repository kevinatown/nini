# Python Notes

## Commands
* `print"statement"` - python2
* `print("statement")` - python3
* % - modulo (returns remainder after division)
* int() - integer, if used on a floating point number, it will round the number down.
* float() - To preserve the decimal, use this
* str() - convert variables to a string

## Definitions
* Strings - a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order
	- print "This is a good string"
	- print 'You can use single quotes or double quotes for a string'
	- print "This is a" + "good string"
* Variables - define things that are subject to change
* float - A number with a decimal point
	- You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10
* boolean - only ever take one of two values. 
	- In Python, we define booleans using the keywords True and False
	-  A value of True corresponds to an integer value of 1, and will behave the same. A value of False corresponds to an integer value of 0.
